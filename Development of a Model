Data Types:
Graph Representation: Nodes represent locations (supply centers, shelters, hospitals), and edges represent transportation routes with associated travel times and conditions.
Supply and Demand Arrays: Arrays representing the quantity of supplies at each location and the demand at each location.

Objective Function and Constraints

Objective Function:
Minimize the total delivery time while meeting the demand at each location.

Constraints:
- Limited supply quantities at each location.
- Varying demand levels at different locations.
- Road conditions and travel times affecting delivery routes.

Example:
Locations (Nodes): Supply center (A), Shelter (B), Hospital (C), etc.
Routes (Edges): A-B (10 minutes), A-C (15 minutes), B-C (5 minutes), etc.
Supplies: A (100 units), B (0 units), C (0 units).
Demands: A (0 units), B (50 units), C (30 units).

Specification of an Algorithm

Chosen Algorithm
The chosen algorithm is a combination of Greedy Algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm (a graph algorithm for shortest paths).
