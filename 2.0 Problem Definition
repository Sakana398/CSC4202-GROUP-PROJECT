SCENARIO
Imagine a city in Terengganu, which has been struck by a severe flood every year. The flood has disrupted infrastructure, causing widespread damage to homes, roads, and utilities. The city is divided into several zones, each with varying levels of flood impact. City authorities face the challenge of allocating limited resources, such as food, water, medical supplies, and rescue teams, to these zones effectively. The objective is to minimize human suffering and maximize the efficiency of the response.

SCENARIO SPECIFICATION
Geographical Setting: Coastal City
Type of Disaster: Flood
Damage Impact:  Infrastructure damage
                Blocked road
                Disrupted communication
                Displaced populations

IMPORTANCE OF AAD FOR THE SCENARIO

1. Efficient Resource Utilization:
During a flood disaster, resources such as food, water, medical supplies, and rescue teams are often limited and need to be distributed efficiently. Using the right algorithms ensures that these resources are allocated optimally, minimizing waste and maximizing their impact where they are most needed.

2. Timely Response:
The right algorithms, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm for calculating shortest paths and the Greedy Technique for resource allocation, facilitate quick decision-making. This agility is crucial in emergency situations where timely response can mean the difference between life and death for affected individuals.

3. Maximized Effectiveness:
Effective algorithms ensure that relief efforts are targeted and effective. By finding the shortest routes and using local optimization techniques, responders can reach affected areas promptly and address critical needs promptly, thereby reducing human suffering and saving lives.

4. Logistical Challenges:
Flood-affected areas often present logistical challenges such as damaged infrastructure, impassable roads, and disrupted communication networks. Algorithms tailored for these scenarios help navigate these challenges by identifying viable routes and adapting plans based on real-time data and conditions.

5. Optimal Decision Support:
Good solutions and appropriate algorithms provide decision-makers with reliable support. They enable informed decisions based on data-driven insights, ensuring that resources are allocated based on actual needs rather than assumptions or guesswork.

6. Community Resilience and Recovery:
Swift and effective response supported by the right algorithms contributes to community resilience and facilitates faster recovery. By mitigating the immediate impacts of the disaster and restoring essential services, these efforts lay the foundation for long-term recovery and rehabilitation.

7. Public Trust and Accountability:
Effective flood relief operations build public trust and confidence in government and relief organizations. By demonstrating competence and responsiveness through well-executed plans and resource management, these entities enhance their credibility and accountability to affected communities.
